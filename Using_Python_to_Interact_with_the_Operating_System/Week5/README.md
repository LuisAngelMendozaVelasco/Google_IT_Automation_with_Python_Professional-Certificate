# Testing in Python

In this module, you’ll learn how to create tests in Python. We’ll cover what testing is all about and dive into the differences between manual versus automated testing. Next, we’ll explore what unit tests are intended to do and how to write them. Then, we’ll learn about other test concepts like black box versus white box tests and how test-driven development can frame how you design and write your code. Finally, you’ll learn about errors and exceptions, and how to combat them.

## Learning Objectives

- Explain what testing is and the different types of testing available
- Describe the difference between black box and white box testing
- Explain test-driven development
- Apply a try-except construct to catch errors and exceptions
