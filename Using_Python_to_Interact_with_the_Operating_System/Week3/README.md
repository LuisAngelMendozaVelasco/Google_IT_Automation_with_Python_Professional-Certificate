# Regular Expressions

In this module, you’ll learn about what a regular expression is and why you would use one. We’ll dive into the basics of regular expressions and give examples of wildcards, repetition qualifiers, escapare characters, and more. Next up, we’ll explore advanced regular expressions and deep dive on repetition qualifiers. You’ll tackle new exercises like capturing groups and extracting PIDs using regexes. Finally, we’ll provide a cheat sheet to serve as your go-to guide for regular expressions.

## Learning Objectives

- Define what a regular expression is and describe why it is useful
- Use basic regular expressions including simple matching, wildcard, and character classes
- Explain repetition qualifiers
- Use advanced regular expressions
