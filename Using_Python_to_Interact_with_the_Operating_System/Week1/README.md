# Getting Your Python On

In this module, you’ll learn about the different types of operating systems, and how you can get your python code ready to interact with the operating system. We’ll learn about getting your environment set up and installing additional Python modules that will help you along the way. We’ll rundown interpreted versus compiled language, and how they differ from each other. We’ll dive into the benefits of automation, and point out common pitfalls so you can avoid them. Finally, we’ll learn about Qwiklabs, which will be used for graded assessments.

## Learning Objectives

- Identify the components and functions of an operating system
- Describe the difference between interpreted and compiled programming languages
- Explain what an IDE (integrated development environment) is
- Install and run Python on a local machine
- List the benefits and pitfalls of automation
