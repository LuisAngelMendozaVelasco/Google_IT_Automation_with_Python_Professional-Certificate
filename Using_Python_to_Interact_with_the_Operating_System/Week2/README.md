# Managing Files with Python

In this module, you’ll learn about reading and writing to files and the commands that will enable you to do this. We’ll learn the importance of managing files and how we can navigate through different directories. We’ll understand how to work with files and how there is a layer of abstraction between Python and the operating system. Finally, we’ll dive into learning about CSV files and how to best utilize them.

## Learning Objectives

- Read, write, and iterate through files
- Manage files by moving, deleting, and renaming files
- Create and navigate through directories
- Define what CSV files are and read from them
- Write and make edits to CSV files within directories
