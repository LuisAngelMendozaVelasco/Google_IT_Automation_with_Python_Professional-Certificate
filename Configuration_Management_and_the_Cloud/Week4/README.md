# Managing Cloud Instances at Scale

In this module, you’ll learn all about storing data in the cloud. You’ll rundown the different types of storage available, like block storage and object storage, and how they differ. You’ll explore load balancing further and dive into some load balancing techniques, like round-robin DNS and sticky sessions. Next, you’ll dive into change management, including the different ways to test your changes and how to push them. You’ll explore different testing methods, like unit tests and integration tests. You’ll also cover continuous integration, the use of continuous deployment, and how to apply A/B testing. Next up, you’ll look at some errors you might encounter along the way, like quotas or limits, and how best to avoid or prepare for these. In the next lesson, you’ll get an understanding of monitoring and altering, and review some systems that offer it. You’ll then dive into the concept of SLA’s and how to set achievable ones. Next, you’ll look at basic monitoring in GCP, and create altering policies, set up conditions, and choose aggregators to manage the data. The last lesson will explore troubleshooting and debugging our systems. You’ll learn how to troubleshoot and debug remotely, understand. techniques for how to identify where the failure is coming from, and how to recover from a failure when it strikes.
