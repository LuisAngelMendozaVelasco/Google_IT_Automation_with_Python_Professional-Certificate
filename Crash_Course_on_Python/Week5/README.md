# Object Oriented Programming (Optional)

In this module, you'll be introduced to the concept of object-oriented programming! You'll learn how to build your own classes with unique qutes and methods. You'll get a chance to write documentation for your classes and methods using docstrings. You'll learn all about object instances and object inheritance, as well as how to import and use Python modules to make use of powerful classes and methods. To round things out, you'll also be introduced to Jupyter notebooks, which we'll use to write and execute more complex code.

## Learning Objectives

- Demonstrate object-oriented programming using classes and objects
- Implement classes with custom attributes and methods
- Write docstrings to document classes and methods
- Leverage inheritance to reduce code duplication
- Import and use Python modules to access powerful classes and methods
