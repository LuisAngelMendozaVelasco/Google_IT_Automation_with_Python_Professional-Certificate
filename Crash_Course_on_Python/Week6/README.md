# Final Project

In this module, you'll learn how to apply a problem-solving framework to tackle a challenging project. You'll learn how to formulate a problem statement to understand a challenge, conduct some research to see what options are available, then begin planning how you to solve a problem.

## Learning Objectives

- Tackle more complex problems from the ground up using a framework
- Formulate a problem statement to understand the inputs and outputs of a script
- Conduct research into options for tackling the problem
- Plan an approach to solving the problem
- Write a complex script in order to implement a solution
