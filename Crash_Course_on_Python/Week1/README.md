# Hello Python!

In this module we’ll introduce you to the Coursera platform and the course format. Then, we’ll dive into the basics of programming languages and syntax, as well as automation using scripting. We’ll also introduce you to the Python programming language and some of the benefits it offers. Last up, we’ll cover some basic functions and keywords of the language, along with some arithmetic operations.

## Learning Objectives

- Define the terms computer program, programming language, script, and automation
- Use the print() function to output data to the screen
- Explain the difference between the syntax and semantics of a programming language
- List some of the characteristics of the Python language
- Utilize basic Python arithmetic operators to obtain the results of mathematical expressions
