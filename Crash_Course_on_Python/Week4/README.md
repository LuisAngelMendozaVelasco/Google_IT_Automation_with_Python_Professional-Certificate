# Strings, Lists and Dictionaries

In this module you'll dive into more advanced ways to manipulate strings using indexing, slicing, and advanced formatting. You'll also explore the more advanced data types: lists, tuples, and dictionaries. You'll learn to store, reference, and manipulate data in these structures, as well as combine them to store complex data structures.

## Learning Objectives

- Manipulate strings using indexing, slicing, and formatting
- Use lists and tuples to store, reference, and manipulate data
- Leverage dictionaries to store more complex data, reference data by keys, and manipulate data stored
- Combine the String, List, and Dictionary data types to construct complex data structures
