# Basic Python Syntax

In this module you’ll learn about different data types in Python, how to identify them, and how to convert between them. You’ll also learn how to use variables to assign data and to reference variables. You’ll deep dive into functions: how to define them, pass them parameters, and have them return information. You’ll explore the concepts of code reuse, code style, and refactoring complex code, along with effectively using code comments. Finally, you’ll learn about comparing data using equality and logical operators, and leveraging these to build complex branching scripts using if statements.

## Learning Objectives

- Differentiate and convert between different data types utilizing variables
- Define and call functions utilizing parameters and return data
- Refactor code and write comments to reduce complexity and enhance code readability and code reuse
- Compare values using equality operators and logical operators
- Build complex branching scripts utilizing if, else and elif statements
